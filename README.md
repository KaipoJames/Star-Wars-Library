# Star Wars Library | Full-Stack Web Application

Star Wars Library is a Full-Stack MERN project showcasing a library of star wars characters, worlds, specices, and more.
Currently, only characters functionality is available until future updates where other models will be added.

## Deployment for this application is underway. Check back tomorrow for updates!
  
## Database Storage
  - All models are stored as documents in an active cluster contained in the non-relational database known as MongoDB.
